Web projects built with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

## Brief

This repo is a central place for gathering all the projects (small / mid-sized) I have built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Each project will include two links: **GitHub** and **Demo**. **GitHub** will contain a basic description of the project and relevant resources; **Demo** will offer a live version of the project.

## Motivation

Learning through practising. This repo works as a roadmap to track programming knowledge I have learned, also an opportunity to tweak or reflect through these projects.
