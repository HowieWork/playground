# Web Is Fun

Web projects built with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

## Brief

Web-is-fun (WIF) is a central place for gathering all the projects (small / mid-sized) I have built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript following courses below:

[50 Projects In 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)

[20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/)

Each project will include two links: **GitHub** and **Demo**. **GitHub** will contain a basic description of the project and relevant resources; **Demo** will offer a live version of the project.

## Motivation

Stay sharp and focus on foundamentals.

Learning through practising. This repo works as a roadmap to track front-end knowledge I have learned, also an opportunity to tweak or reflect through these projects.
